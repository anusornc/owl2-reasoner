# OWL2 Reasoner Benchmarking Suite

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive benchmarking system for the OWL2 Reasoner, including internal performance metrics and external comparisons with established OWL2 reasoners.

## Benchmarking Architecture

### 1. Internal Benchmark Suite (`benches/`)

The internal benchmark suite uses the Criterion.rs framework to provide detailed performance analysis:

#### Key Benchmark Categories:

1. **Reasoning Performance Benchmarks**
   - Consistency checking across all reasoning modes
   - Class satisfiability checking
   - Subclass relationship validation
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Large-scale ontology processing

2. **Parser Performance Benchmarks**
   - Multi-format parsing performance
   - Memory efficiency during parsing
   - Scalability with large ontologies

3. **Query Performance Benchmarks**
   - SPARQL-like query execution
   - Pattern matching optimization
   - Result streaming performance

4. **Memory and Scalability Benchmarks**
   - Memory footprint analysis
   - Garbage collection impact
   - Vertical and horizontal scaling

#### Running Internal Benchmarks:

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmark suite
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmark
cargo bench consistency_checking

# Run with custom configuration
cargo bench -- --sample-size 100 --measurement-time 10

# Build benches without executing (sanity check only)
cargo bench --no-run

# Build a specific bench target without running
cargo bench --no-run --bench parser_bench
```

### 2. External Benchmarking System (`benchmarking/`)

The external benchmarking system compares our Rust implementation against established Java-based OWL2 reasoners:

#### Supported Reasoners:
- **ELK**: Lightweight OWL2 EL reasoner
- **HermiT**: High-performance OWL2 reasoner
- **JFact**: OWL2 reasoner with extensive feature support
- **Pellet**: Full-featured OWL2 DL reasoner

#### Setup External Reasoners:

```bash
# Navigate to benchmarking directory
cd benchmarking/established_reasoners

# Run setup script
./setup_reasoners.sh

# Test downloaded reasoners
./test_reasoners.sh
```

#### Head-to-Head Comparison:

```bash
# Run comprehensive comparison
./run_head_to_head.sh
```

## Performance Metrics

### Internal Metrics

1. **Execution Time**
   - Average reasoning time per operation
   - P95 and P99 latency percentiles
   - Throughput (operations/second)

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Peak memory consumption
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Garbage collection overhead

3. **Scalability**
   - Performance vs ontology size
   - Memory efficiency scaling
   - Concurrent processing capability

### External Comparison Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - OWL2 feature support coverage
   - Compliance with W3C specifications
   - Handling of complex ontologies

2. **Performance Comparison**
   - Relative speed vs established reasoners
   - Memory efficiency comparison
   - Startup time and initialization

3. **Correctness**
   - Consistency of reasoning results
   - Compliance with OWL2 semantics
   - Edge case handling

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Benchmark Creation

```rust
// Example custom benchmark
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

fn custom_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("custom_operation", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            // Your custom operation here
            black_box(operation_to_benchmark());
        })
    });
}

criterion_group!(benches, custom_benchmark);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

### Benchmark Configuration Options

- **Sample Size**: Number of iterations (default: 50)
- **Measurement Time**: Duration per benchmark (default: 5s)
- **Warm-up Time**: Preparation time (default: 1s)
