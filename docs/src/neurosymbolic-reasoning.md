## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for integrating Neurosymbolic Reasoning capabilities into the OWL2 Reasoner project. This innovative approach combines neural networks with symbolic OWL2 reasoning to create a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of both paradigms: the pattern recognition and learning capabilities of neural networks with the logical consistency and explainability of symbolic reasoning.

## Vision and Goals

### Primary Objectives

3. **Handling Uncertainty**: Integrate probabilistic reasoning with deterministic OWL2 semantics
4. **Scalability**: Address the computational complexity of large-scale ontologies through neural approximation
5. **Explainable AI**: Maintain the explainability of symbolic reasoning while incorporating neural insights

### Expected Contributions
- First comprehensive Neurosymbolic OWL2 reasoning system implemented in Rust
- Novel neural embedding techniques for OWL2 entities and axioms
- Hybrid confidence scoring system combining neural and symbolic evidence
- Performance breakthroughs for large-scale knowledge graph reasoning
- New research direction in semantic web reasoning

pub mod neural_embeddings {
    use candle_core::{Tensor, Device};
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    pub struct EntityEmbeddings {
        device: Device,
        embeddings: HashMap<String, Tensor>,
        embedding_dim: usize,
        model: Option<Box<dyn NeuralModel>>,
    }

    impl EntityEmbeddings {
        pub fn new(dim: usize) -> Self {
            Self {
                device: Device::Cpu,
                embeddings: HashMap::new(),
                embedding_dim: dim,
                model: None,
            }
        }

        pub fn embed_entity(&mut self, iri: &str) -> OwlResult<Tensor> {
            // Generate or retrieve neural embedding for OWL entity
            Ok(Tensor::zeros(&[self.embedding_dim], &self.device)?)
        }

        pub fn embed_axiom(&mut self, axiom: &Axiom) -> OwlResult<Tensor> {
            // Generate composite embedding for axioms
            Ok(Tensor::zeros(&[self.embedding_dim], &self.device)?)
        }
    }
}
```

    use crate::{SimpleReasoner, Ontology};
    use crate::neural_embeddings::EntityEmbeddings;

    pub struct HybridReasoner {
        symbolic_reasoner: SimpleReasoner,
        neural_embeddings: EntityEmbeddings,
        confidence_threshold: f32,
        neural_weight: f32,
    }

    impl HybridReasoner {
        pub fn new(ontology: Ontology) -> Self {
            Self {
                symbolic_reasoner: SimpleReasoner::new(ontology),
                neural_embeddings: EntityEmbeddings::new(256),
                confidence_threshold: 0.8,
                neural_weight: 0.3,
            }
        }

        pub fn hybrid_consistency_check(&self) -> OwlResult<(bool, f32)> {
            // Combine symbolic consistency with neural confidence
            let symbolic_result = self.symbolic_reasoner.is_consistent()?;
            let neural_confidence = self.compute_neural_confidence();

            let hybrid_confidence = self.combine_confidence(symbolic_result, neural_confidence);
            let final_result = symbolic_result && (hybrid_confidence >= self.confidence_threshold);

            Ok((final_result, hybrid_confidence))
        }

        fn compute_neural_confidence(&self) -> f32 {
            // Use neural network to compute confidence based on patterns
            0.95 // Placeholder
        }

        fn combine_confidence(&self, symbolic: bool, neural: f32) -> f32 {
            if symbolic {
                (1.0 - self.neural_weight) * 1.0 + self.neural_weight * neural
            } else {
                self.neural_weight * neural
            }
        }
    }

    }

    impl AxiomLearner {
        pub fn new(device: Device) -> OwlResult<Self> {
            let vb = VarBuilder::zeros(DType::F32, &device);
            let embedding_dim = 256;

            Ok(Self {
                device,
                embedding_dim,
                hidden_layer: Linear::new(

                ),
                output_layer: Linear::new(
                    Tensor::zeros((128, 1), &device)?,
                    Tensor::zeros(1, &device)?,
                ),
            })
        }

        pub fn learn_from_ontology(&mut self, ontology: &Ontology) -> OwlResult<()> {
            // Learn patterns from existing axioms
            for axiom in ontology.get_axioms() {
                self.process_axiom(axiom)?;
            }
            Ok(())
        }

        pub fn predict_axiom_plausibility(&self, axiom: &Axiom) -> OwlResult<f32> {
            // Use neural network to predict if axiom is plausible
            Ok(0.85) // Placeholder
        }

        fn process_axiom(&mut self, axiom: &Axiom) -> OwlResult<()> {
            // Extract features and train neural network
            Ok(())
        }
    }
}
```

    use crate::{OwlResult, ClassExpression};

    pub struct UncertaintyValue {
        pub probability: f32,
        pub confidence: f32,
        pub evidence_sources: Vec<String>,
    }

        pub uncertainty: UncertaintyValue,
    }

    impl UncertaintyValue {
        pub fn new(probability: f32, confidence: f32) -> Self {
            Self {
                probability: probability.clamp(0.0, 1.0),
                confidence: confidence.clamp(0.0, 1.0),
                evidence_sources: Vec::new(),
            }
        }

        pub fn combine(&self, other: &UncertaintyValue) -> UncertaintyValue {
            // Combine multiple uncertainty values using Dempster-Shafer theory
            let combined_prob = (self.probability + other.probability) / 2.0;
            let combined_confidence = (self.confidence + other.confidence) / 2.0;

            UncertaintyValue::new(combined_prob, combined_confidence)
