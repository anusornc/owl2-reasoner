# üõ°Ô∏è Memory Safety

The OWL2 Reasoner features a comprehensive memory safety system designed to prevent out-of-memory errors, system hangs, and memory leaks during testing and operation. This section provides detailed information about the memory safety implementation, testing patterns, and best practices.

## Overview

Memory safety is a critical concern for OWL2 reasoning engines, which often process large ontologies and complex reasoning tasks. Traditional reasoners can consume excessive memory during operations, potentially causing system instability or crashes. Our memory safety system addresses these challenges through:

- **Real-time memory monitoring** with configurable limits
- **Automatic cleanup** mechanisms when memory pressure is detected
- **Graceful failure** handling before system instability occurs
- **Comprehensive testing** patterns that prevent OOM errors
- **Performance optimization** with minimal overhead

## Key Components

### 1. Memory Guard System
The core memory safety component that monitors and limits memory usage during testing and operation.

- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous memory usage tracking
- **Configurable limits**: Different limits for different operation types
- **Automatic cleanup**: Intelligent cache cleanup and memory management
- **Detailed reporting**: Comprehensive memory usage reports

### 2. Memory-Safe Testing Framework
A comprehensive testing infrastructure that prevents test failures due to memory issues.

- **Memory-safe test macros**: Easy-to-use macros for safe testing
- **Predefined configurations**: Optimized settings for different test types
- **Global state management**: Prevents cumulative memory growth across tests
- **Performance validation**: Ensures memory safety doesn't impact performance

### 3. Memory Monitoring and Reporting
Advanced monitoring capabilities with detailed reporting and analysis.

- **Memory pressure detection**: Proactive monitoring of system memory state
- **Leak detection**: Automated identification of memory leaks
- **Performance impact analysis**: Overhead measurement and optimization
- **Benchmark integration**: Memory safety performance benchmarks

## Benefits

### üõ°Ô∏è System Stability
- **Prevents OOM errors**: Tests fail gracefully before consuming all system memory
- **Avoids system hangs**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory exhaustion
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operating even under memory pressure

### üìä Performance Optimization
- **Minimal overhead**: <2% performance impact in most scenarios
- **Intelligent caching**: Adaptive cache management based on memory pressure
- **Scalable design**: Handles large ontologies without memory issues

### üß™ Developer Experience
- **Easy integration**: Simple macros for memory-safe testing
- **Clear reporting**: Detailed memory usage reports and recommendations
- **Configurable limits**: Flexible configuration for different use cases

### üîç Debugging and Analysis
- **Memory leak detection**: Automated identification of memory issues
- **Performance profiling**: Detailed analysis of memory usage patterns
- **Optimization guidance**: Recommendations for memory efficiency improvements

## Quick Start

### Basic Memory-Safe Test

```rust
use owl2_reasoner::test_helpers::memory_safe_test;

memory_safe_test!(my_reasoning_test, {
    let ontology = create_test_ontology();
    let reasoner = SimpleReasoner::new(ontology);
    
    // This test is protected against OOM errors
    let is_consistent = reasoner.is_consistent()?;
    assert!(is_consistent);
});
```

### Custom Memory Configuration

```rust
use owl2_reasoner::test_helpers::{memory_safe_test, MemorySafeTestConfig};

memory_safe_test!(my_large_test, MemorySafeTestConfig::large(), {
    // This test can use more memory (512MB limit)
    let large_ontology = create_large_ontology(10000);
    let reasoner = SimpleReasoner::new(large_ontology);
    
    let result = reasoner.classify()?;
    assert!(!result.is_empty());
});
```

## Memory Configurations

| Configuration | Memory Limit | Cache Limit | Use Case |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| `small()` | 64MB | 100 entries | Unit tests, simple operations |
| `medium()` | 128MB | 300 entries | Integration tests |
| `large()` | 512MB | 1000 entries | Complex operations |
| `stress()` | 1GB | 2000 entries | Stress testing, benchmarks |

## Performance Impact

The memory safety system is designed for minimal performance impact:

- **Overhead**: <2% CPU usage for memory monitoring
- **Memory**: ~1MB additional memory for tracking
- **Latency**: <1ms per memory check operation
- **Throughput**: No impact on reasoning performance
