# Performance Optimization Baseline & Targets

## Current Baseline (Complete Validation Results)

| Performance Metric | Current Result | Target | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Sub-millisecond response times** | 0.110 ms average | < 1.0 ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Memory efficiency** | 438.86 KB per entity | < 10 KB per entity | ❌ FAIL |
| **Cache hit rate** | 50.0% (15 hits, 15 misses) | 85-95% | ❌ FAIL |
| **Arc sharing efficiency** | 0.0% sharing ratio | > 30% | ❌ FAIL |

## Optimization Strategy

### Priority 1: Cache Hit Rate (50% → 90%)
- **Issue**: 50% hit rate is too low, indicates poor cache utilization
- **Actions**: 
  - Increase cache TTL values
  - Improve cache key generation
  - Add more granular caching
  - Implement cache warming strategies

### Priority 2: Memory Efficiency (438KB → <10KB per entity)
- **Issue**: Current memory usage is 44x the target
- **Actions**:
  - Implement string interning for IRIs
  - Use more compact data structures
  - Optimize ontology storage layout
  - Reduce per-entity overhead

### Priority 3: Arc Sharing (0% → >30%)
- **Issue**: No sharing detected, indicates duplicate entities
- **Actions**:
  - Implement entity pooling/deduplication
  - Use shared references for common entities
  - Optimize ontology loading to reuse Arc pointers

### Priority 4: Response Time (0.110ms → <0.050ms)
- **Issue**: While passing, can be further optimized
- **Actions**:
  - Optimize reasoning algorithms
  - Reduce allocation in hot paths
  - Improve data locality

## Next Steps
1. Start with cache optimization (highest impact)
2. Move to memory efficiency improvements
3. Implement Arc sharing mechanisms
4. Fine-tune overall performance

## Success Metrics
- All 4 claims must be validated with real measurements
- No regression in previously passing metrics
- Maintain code quality and test coverage
