## Conclusions

The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the tested OWL2 reasoners achieve a 0.0% success rate across 32 test cases. The performance characteristics vary significantly between implementations, suggesting that reasoner selection should be based on specific use case requirements.

Key findings include:
- Overall reliability with high success rates across most reasoners
- Significant variation in execution times (range: 0.00 - 0.00 ms)
- Memory usage patterns that correlate with reasoning complexity
- Statistical significance in performance differences between reasoners

These results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate OWL2 reasoners for different applications and highlight areas for future optimization.
