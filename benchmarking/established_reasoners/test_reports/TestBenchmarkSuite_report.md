## Detailed Results

| Reasoner | Type | Operation | Success | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Reasoner1 | library | classification | ✓ | 150.50 | N/A |
| Reasoner2 | cli_tool | consistency | ✓ | 200.30 | N/A |


## Conclusions

The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the tested OWL2 reasoners achieve a 100.0% success rate across 2 test cases. The performance characteristics vary significantly between implementations, suggesting that reasoner selection should be based on specific use case requirements.

Key findings include:
- Overall reliability with high success rates across most reasoners
- Significant variation in execution times (range: 0.00 - 0.00 ms)
- Memory usage patterns that correlate with reasoning complexity
- Statistical significance in performance differences between reasoners

These results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate OWL2 reasoners for different applications and highlight areas for future optimization.
